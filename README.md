An deep learning attempt to predict malaria from microscopic examination of blood using blood films

## Background:
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.
Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.

 #### Signs and symptoms
 A malaria infection is generally characterized by the following signs and symptoms:
- Fever
- Chills
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Muscle pain and fatigue

Other signs and symptoms may include:
- Sweating
- Chest or abdominal pain
- Cough

#### Diagnosis: 
Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.

#### Prevalence:
The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator including much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
- In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 445,000 to 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa.
- Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014, during which there were 198 million cases.

#### Risk Factor:
Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.
